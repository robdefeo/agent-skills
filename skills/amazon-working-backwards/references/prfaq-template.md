## Document Structure Overview {#structure}

A PR-FAQ consists of two parts:

1. **Press Release (PR)**: A fictional press release announcing the product as if it already launched. Written for the customer, not for internal stakeholders. ~1 page.
2. **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**: Divided into External FAQ (customer questions) and Internal FAQ (stakeholder/leadership questions). ~2-5 pages.

Total target length: 3-6 pages.

## Press Release Template {#press-release}

```markdown
# [Product Name] — [One-line value proposition]

**[City, State]** — **[Date]** — [Company name] today announced [Product Name],
[one sentence describing what it does and who it's for].

[Customer problem paragraph: 2-3 sentences describing the problem customers face
today. Use specific, quantified language. This should feel like real customer pain.]

[Solution paragraph: 2-3 sentences describing how the product solves the problem.
Focus on the customer experience and the primary benefit, not on technical
implementation.]

[Quote from company leader: A quote from a VP or director-level leader explaining
why this matters. Format: "Quote text," said [Name], [Title] at [Company]. "Second
sentence of quote."]

[How it works paragraph: 2-3 sentences giving a high-level walkthrough of the
customer experience. Concrete and action-oriented — what does the customer DO?]

[Customer quote: A fictional quote from a representative customer. Format: "Quote
text," said [Name], [Title] at [Customer Company]. "Second sentence of quote."]

[Call to action: One sentence on availability and how to get started. Include a
fictional URL or sign-up path.]
```

### Press Release Quality Bar

- Written in the **past tense** (as if the product already launched)
- Avoids jargon — a smart non-technical person should understand it
- The first paragraph answers: What is it? Who is it for? Why should they care?
- Every paragraph earns its place — if you removed it, would the reader lose something?
- No superlatives without evidence ("best," "revolutionary," "groundbreaking")
- Quotes sound like things a real person would say, not marketing copy

## Writing Standards {#standards}

### Amazon Writing Principles Applied to PR-FAQs

- **Customer obsession**: Every sentence should serve the customer's understanding
- **Concreteness over abstraction**: Numbers, examples, and specifics over hand-waving
- **Intellectual honesty**: Acknowledge what you don't know; don't oversell
- **Clarity**: Short sentences, active voice, no jargon
- **Narrative structure**: The PR tells a story: problem → solution → evidence → experience → action

### Tone

- Confident but not arrogant
- Specific but not drowning in detail
- Professional but not corporate-speak
- Honest about limitations and risks (especially in Internal FAQ)

### Common Rejection Reasons

PR-FAQs get sent back for revision when they:

1. Don't clearly articulate the customer problem (solution-first thinking)
2. Can't name a specific customer segment
3. Lack evidence that customers actually want this
4. Have benefits that don't connect to the stated problem
5. Read like a technical design doc instead of a customer-facing announcement
6. Have FAQs that dodge hard questions instead of answering them
7. Are too long — if it takes 10 pages, the thinking isn't clear enough
