description: Guide the Amazon Working Backwards process from the 5 Questions through to a full PR-FAQ document. Use when the user wants to (1) draft answers to the Amazon 5 Questions for a proposal or idea, (2) refine or critique existing 5Q answers, (3) verify and challenge 5Q answers with probing questions, (4) generate a PR-FAQ document from 5Q answers, (5) review or critique an existing PR-FAQ against Amazon standards, or (6) clarify any element of the 5Q or PR-FAQ process. Triggers include mentions of "5 questions," "PR-FAQ," "PRFAQ," "working backwards," "press release FAQ," Amazon-style proposals, or requests to write/review product proposals in Amazon format.

# Amazon Working Backwards

The Working Backwards process moves from idea to PR-FAQ in two phases: first answer the 5 Questions to force clarity of thinking, then write a PR-FAQ document that brings the idea to life for readers.

## Workflow

Determine the entry point based on what the user provides:

**Starting from a rough idea or proposal?** → Follow the "5 Questions Phase" below
**Have 5Q answers to refine/verify?** → Read [references/five-questions-guide.md](references/five-questions-guide.md) and apply the verification checklist
**Ready to write a PR-FAQ?** → Follow the "PR-FAQ Phase" below
**Have a PR-FAQ to review?** → Read [references/prfaq-template.md](references/prfaq-template.md) and evaluate against the writing standards and common rejection reasons
**Want to clarify a specific element?** → Read the relevant reference file for that phase

## Output Convention

Always write to a file from the start. Do not draft in chat.

- **5Q answers**: Write to `YYYY-MM-DD - [Product Name] 5Q.md`
- **PR-FAQ**: Write to `YYYY-MM-DD - [Product Name] PR-FAQ.md`
- **Iterations**: Edit the file in place; summarize changes in chat
- **Word format**: If the user requests .docx, use the `docx` skill to produce a formatted document

When asking clarifying questions or presenting feedback, respond in chat. All substantive content (5Q answers, PR-FAQ drafts) goes to file.

## 5 Questions Phase

The 5 Questions force clarity before any document writing begins:

1. **Who is the customer?**
2. **What is the customer problem or opportunity?**
3. **What is the most important customer benefit?**
4. **How do we know what the customer needs or wants?**
5. **What does the customer experience look like?**

### Drafting 5Q Answers

1. Read [references/five-questions-guide.md](references/five-questions-guide.md) for the quality bar and pitfalls for each question
2. Read [references/examples.md](references/examples.md) to see a worked example from idea through 5Q to PR-FAQ
3. Ask clarifying questions if the user's idea is too vague to answer any question well — ask one question at a time
4. Draft all 5 answers, following the "What a strong answer looks like" guidance for each
5. Write answers to the 5Q file; summarize in chat and ask for feedback; iterate by editing the file

### Verifying 5Q Answers

When reviewing or verifying answers (user's own or previously drafted):

1. Read [references/five-questions-guide.md](references/five-questions-guide.md)
2. Apply the verification checklist (coherence, specificity, customer obsession, intellectual honesty)
3. Use the probing questions from the guide to challenge weak areas
4. Present specific, actionable feedback — not generic praise

## PR-FAQ Phase

Once 5Q answers are solid, generate the PR-FAQ document.

1. Read [references/prfaq-template.md](references/prfaq-template.md) for the exact structure and quality bar
2. Read [references/examples.md](references/examples.md) if not already loaded
3. Write the Press Release section, mapping: Q2 → problem paragraph, Q3 → solution paragraph, Q5 → experience paragraph, Q1 → customer quote persona
4. Write External FAQ (5-10 customer questions)
5. Write Internal FAQ (5-10 stakeholder questions)
6. Write to the PR-FAQ file; summarize in chat and ask for feedback; iterate by editing the file

### Reviewing an Existing PR-FAQ

1. Read [references/prfaq-template.md](references/prfaq-template.md), paying attention to the "Common Rejection Reasons" section
2. Evaluate each section of the PR-FAQ against the writing standards
3. Check that the PR-FAQ is internally consistent (problem → benefit → experience alignment)
4. Provide specific, section-by-section feedback with concrete suggestions for improvement
