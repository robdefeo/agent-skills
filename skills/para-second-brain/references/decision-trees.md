# PARA Decision Trees

## Three-Question Method (Primary)

Use these in order and stop at the first "yes":

1. What project would this be useful for?
2. If none, which area will this be useful for?
3. If none, which resource does this belong to?

If all answers are "no": delete it, or create a new folder only if the topic is important and recurring.

## Project vs Area

```text
Start
  |
  +-- Will this ever be complete?
       |
       +-- Yes -> Project
       |
       +-- No -> Area
```

Project: goal-oriented, time-bound, clear outcome.
Area: ongoing responsibility, standard to maintain, never fully done.

## Should I Create a New Folder?

```text
New content does not fit existing folders
  |
  +-- Will this recur or grow?
       |
       +-- No -> File under closest existing folder
       |
       +-- Yes
            |
            +-- Is it distinct from current folders?
                 |
                 +-- No -> Reuse existing folder
                 |
                 +-- Yes -> Create new folder
```

Create folders for meaningful, recurring topics. Avoid micro-categories.

## Meeting Notes Placement

```text
Meeting notes
  |
  +-- Is the meeting tied to an active project?
       |
       +-- Yes -> Project folder
       |
       +-- No
            |
            +-- Is it part of an ongoing responsibility?
                 |
                 +-- Yes -> Area folder
                 |
                 +-- No -> Resource folder
```

## Recurring Activities

```text
Recurring activity
  |
  +-- Does each cycle have a concrete deliverable and endpoint?
       |
       +-- Yes -> Separate project instances (e.g., Q1 Planning)
       |
       +-- No
            |
            +-- Is this an ongoing responsibility?
                 |
                 +-- Yes -> Area
                 |
                 +-- No -> Resource
```

## Dual-Fit Tie Breaker

When an item plausibly fits multiple categories, apply actionability priority:

1. Projects
2. Areas
3. Resources

Example: research notes actively used for a live project go in the project first; optionally extract durable reference notes to Resources later.
